Welcome to the Indian Unemployment Analysis repository! In this project, we've harnessed the power of Python's data analysis and visualization libraries to dissect the 'Unemployment in India' dataset. Starting with essential libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, we seamlessly progressed through data loading and inspection, ensuring a solid understanding of the dataset's structure. Our journey continued with data cleanliness, handling missing values, and visualizing relationships between variables using Seaborn's pair plot and heatmap. Renaming columns for clarity paved the way for a more intuitive exploration. The analysis delves into histograms showcasing the distribution of Estimated Employed and Estimated Unemployment Rate (%) across different regions. The finale involves an advanced visualization using Plotly Expressâ€”a captivating sunburst chart offering an interactive and hierarchical exploration of Estimated Unemployment Rate (%) across regions.
